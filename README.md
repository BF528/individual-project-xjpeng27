# Transcriptional Profile of Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration with mRNA-Seq¶

High-throughput sequencing technologies provide researchers a strong tool to understand and analyze genome-wide gene expression dataset, this project aims to explore the differences in the transcriptional profiles of neonatal and adult mice using mRNA abundance data
from Transcriptional Profile of Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration. Since I was the programmer of project2, I take the cuffdiff output generated in project 2 section 5 and use it to replicate section 6, which is to identify differentially expressed genes association with myocyte differentiation and the biological interpretation. We will attempt to replicate their primary findings in this project using current analytical methodology and software packages.
